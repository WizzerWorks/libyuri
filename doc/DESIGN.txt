#	1. General

# 	2. Coding standard
## 	2.1 Naming
Variable names should contain only lower case letters, numbers and underscores.
Underscores at the beginning of identifier should be avoided.
Type names should end with _t
Structs should be used to implement simple types with public attributes and named as types
Classes names should begin with upper case letter and 
Shared pointer to a class should have name of the class prefixed with 'p'
Weak pointer to a class should have name of the class prefixed with 'pw'
 
Classes should follow NVI principle
Private attributes should be denoted by trailing underscore
Getters in classes can be implemented in class definition to allow inlining

#	3. Types
time_t - 			Timestamp (with at least 100ns precision)
time_duration_t		Time duration (with precision at least the same as time_t)
resolution_t		Format for representinv width, height and x, y offset 
range_t				Value range
size_t				Unsigned large integer (uint64_t?)
			
raw_video_format_t
plane_format_t

enum interlace_t	Types of interlacing (progressive, segmented_frame, interlace, split)
enum field_order_t	Field order for interlaced modes (None, TFF, BFF)

#	4. Frames
Frame is a fundamental unit of data (video, audio, text, 3D data...)
For uncompressed types it should contain 1 logical unit of data (1 video frame,

##	4.1 Generic frame (Frame)
Should be abstract
###	4.1.1 Attributes
[private] 	time_t				timestamp_ 
[private] 	time_duration_t		duration_
[private]	string				format_name_    Name of format, if known (ie.1080p30)
###	4.1.2 Members
[public] 	time_t 				get_timestamp() const
[public] 	void				set_timestamp(const time_t&) 
[public] 	duration_t			get_duration() const
[public] 	void				set_duration(const duration_t&) 
[public]	pFrame				get_copy()			

[private, virtual]	pFrame		get_copy() = 0 {}
[protected, virtual] void		copy_parameters(pFrame&}	

##	4.2 Video frame
Video frame should be an abstraction for generic video frame (either compressed or uncompressed)
###	4.2.1 Attributes
[private]	resolution_t		resolution_
[private]	interlace_t			interlacing_
[private]	field_order_t		field_order_

## 	4.3 Raw video frame
### 4.3.1
[private]	size_t				num_planes_
[private]	raw_format_t		format_
###	4.3.2

###	4.3.3. Raw video plane
[private]	plane_format_t		format_	
[private]	resolution_t		resolution_
